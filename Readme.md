MediConnect – Community-Driven Medicine Expiry & Availability Tracker 🚀 Overview

MediConnect is a community-driven platform that connects users, pharmacies, and NGOs/hospitals to solve three key problems:

Expired Medicines at Home – Track expiry dates, get reminders, and donate before expiry.

Emergency Medicine Search – Check real-time local availability of medicines nearby.

Safe Medicine Donation – Connect users with verified NGOs/hospitals/pharmacies for legal and safe medicine donations.

Unlike existing apps (1mg, PharmEasy), the focus is not on delivery but on real-time availability, expiry management, and donation networks.

✨ Key Features 👤 User Side
